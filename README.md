# Optimal-Foraging
This is part of a research project with Prof. Andrew Bernoff and Prof. Jasper Weinburd of the Mathematics department at Harvey Mudd College, investigating optimal foraging in locust swarms.
<h3>Current Status</h3>
<p>The rudimentary model seems to be up and running. The next step, I think, is to fit the model with biologically realistic parameters for things like sensing radius and gregarization threshold. Even without those, the model already shows some potentially interesting results. In this image, different colors represent different simulations. So it seems that there are numerous fixed points, and that the populations reach some kind of equilibrium within 6 or 7 generations.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p> A striking characteristic of locusts is that when they are repeatedly stimulated by other locusts, they undergo a behavioural and physiological phase change in which they become gregarious. This gregarization is a neccessary component for destructive locust swarms to form, which can include millions of locusts flying in unison. </p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In this package we aim to investigate marching locusts on a 2d grid. Initially, locusts are split between a control group that moves according to a random walk, and a gregarizing group that moves according to rules for either gregarious or solitary locusts. The population evolves based on whichever locusts have the best and worst foraging efficiencies.

<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>The locust class in <a href="https://github.com/ymaltsman/Optimal-Foraging/blob/master/classes/locust.py">locust.py</a> contains the properties and methods for individual locusts, such as their rules for eating and moving. The gridpoint class in<a href="https://github.com/ymaltsman/Optimal-Foraging/blob/master/classes/gridpoint.py"> gridpoint.py</a> contains the properties and methods for individual points that make up the 2d grid. These include the number of locusts and resources on a point, and rules for depletion and gain of resources. <a href="https://github.com/ymaltsman/Optimal-Foraging/blob/master/simulate.py">simulate.py</a> contains a function dictating the simulation of the genetic algorithm itself, and contains parameters for the time period, size of the grid, and number and makeup of the locusts. Finally, <a href="https://github.com/ymaltsman/Optimal-Foraging/blob/master/analysis.py">analysis.py</a> contains a few functions functions for testing and visualizing the results of the model.</p>
