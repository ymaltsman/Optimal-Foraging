<h3>Status update for June 10th</h3>
<p>Main takeaways for today are that </p>

* Gregarization seems to reach a steady state during a generation
* Average gregarization increases as the ratio of resources to locusts increases, in line with what we expect
<p>These two plots show how average phase changes over 10,000 iterations for two different initial conditions:</p>

<p>This plot samples average gregarization at various initial conditions, plotting resources/locust vs average gregarization:</p>
