<h3>Status update for June 16th</h3>
<p>Some pictures generated, leading up to individual trajectories of locusts.</p>
<p>This plot shows that after a long enough time period, for a low gregarization threshold, locusts move in a pulse.</p>

<p> With an extremely high threshold, the locusts movement remains random. </p>
