<h3>Status update for June 22nd</h3>
<h4>Added pause and go mechanism to model </h4>
<h4> Added stochastic element to movement for gregarized locusts </h4>
<h4> It seems like gregarized locusts now move in somewhat of a wide band </h4>
<h4> Changing # of locusts and gregarization threshold can cause degregerization and oscillation between different levels of gregerization </h4>
<p>Instead of all of the locusts in the same place as before, they are now moving in the same direction but spread apart.</p>

Degregerization seems to occur as we vary the number of locusts and the gregarization threshold (first two images) but not when we change the probability of moving with the other locusts (third). *Note that the second image should have the title "Change in gregarization based on gregarization threshold" not based on 'p'
