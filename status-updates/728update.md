We find what seem to be bifurcations in the dynamics of the system as gamma and k are adjusted.
We see in this image that gregarious locusts outperform solitary ones.

When we increase k by .01, this switches pretty drastically:

As we increase gamma, we would expect gregarious locusts to perform better, but instead the discrepency increases in favor of solitary locusts, with both groups' populations lower.

We increase gamma and the discrepancy increases even more.

BUT, there appears to be another bifurcation when we increases gamma by .01:

And then if we decrease k by a bit, the discrepency switches in favor of gregarious locusts:
