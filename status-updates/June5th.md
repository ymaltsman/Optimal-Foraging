<h3>Status 6/5</h3>
<p>The rudimentary model seems to be up and running. The next step, I think, is to fit the model with biologically realistic parameters for things like sensing radius and gregarization threshold. Even without those, the model already shows some potentially interesting results. In this image, different colors represent different simulations. So it seems that there are numerous fixed points, and that the populations reach some kind of equilibrium within 6 or 7 generations.</p>
